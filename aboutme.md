title: About me
---


Collaboration and applications to human health are the main motivators for my work. After my PhD and Postdoc, I hope to become a Professor in Statistics or Biostatistics or work within a clinical research group. Mentoring is important to me, and I served as a peer mentor for 3 years at Texas A&M and a graduate mentor for several semesters in the directed reading program at Cornell for undergraduates in math/statistics.

Outside of work I enjoy walking nature trails, weightlifting, sports, and birding with Merlin. At Cornell I organized the Statistics PhD student intramural sand volleyball team that recorded at least one win over our three years, and I joined an Ithaca kickball league. I like to try out new activities even if they don't stick, like rock-climbing and running (slowly).
